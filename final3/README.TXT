Instructions
In order to run our implementation, follow these steps:
1)	unzip files
2)	compile with “make”
3)	for performance comparison: run “./time_test.native n op”
where n is the number of elements to be inserted in the tree, and op could be a string “o” for ordered elements, “r” for random elements, and “ns” for elements that can only range from 0 to (n/1000 + 2)
4)	you may also run “./testing.native” for the structural tests
